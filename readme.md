| Responsive boilerplate | A responsive boilerplate optimized for the multi-screen web. Powered by [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). |
| Pug suppoprt | Compile [Pug](https://pugjs.org) into HTML with ease, write Pug syntax and mix it with Javascript to give more freedom. (Run `gulp pug` to compile)|
